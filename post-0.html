            <p>
                Today marks the beginning of my ambitious challenge: building 12 startups in 12 months. 
                Starting March 1st, I'll be dedicating each month to building and launching a new startup 
                from scratch. This journey is about learning, building in public, and pushing my limits 
                as a maker.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Challenge?</h2>
            <p>
                As a software engineer, I've spent years building things for others. Now, I want to 
                challenge myself to build and launch my own products. The goal isn't just to build 
                12 startups - it's to learn about different markets, experiment with various 
                technologies, and understand what it takes to launch successful products.
            </p>

            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each startup must be built and launched within 30 days</li>
                <li>All progress will be documented and shared publicly</li>
                <li>Each project must have a clear revenue model</li>
                <li>Must launch even if it's not perfect</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout this journey, I'll be documenting everything - from ideation to launch, 
                including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Daily progress updates</li>
                <li>Technical decisions and challenges</li>
                <li>Marketing strategies and results</li>
                <li>Revenue and metrics</li>
                <li>Lessons learned</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>First Project Hints</h2>
            <p>
                For March, I already have a clear idea of what I'll be building. It's a tool that 
                solves a problem I've personally experienced as a developer. More details coming soon!
            </p>
