                Today marks the beginning of my ambitious challenge: building 12 startups in 12 months. 
                Starting March 1st, I'll be dedicating each month to building and launching a new startup 
                from scratch.
            </p>

            <h2>Why This Challenge?</h2>
            <p>
                I tried twice to buid a atartup before, and both times I failed.
                Then I read about <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">Peter Levels' 12 startups in 12 months experience</a>,
                and others like him. They inspired me to try again.
            </p>

            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Each startup must be built and launched within 30 days</li>
                <li>All progress will be documented and shared publicly</li>
                <li>Must launch even if it's not perfect</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>First Project Hints</h2>
            <p>
                For March, I have found a problem that someone is facing. I'll be building a tool that 
                solves that problem. Details to come. 
            </p>

            <h2>Follow Along</h2>
            <p>
                I'll be sharing daily updates on <a href="https://x.com/321_null">X</a> and 
                writing detailed blog posts here about each startup. Subscribe to my newsletter (coming soon) 
                to get updates directly in your inbox.
